> When you look at the FTX settlement with the CFTC, it's pretty remarkable how quickly they've managed to recover assets. The US Bankruptcy system actually worked here. The team put in place has recovered almost 100% of customer funds, which nobody thought was possible. I think it says something positive about the resilience of crypto markets despite the scandal.
